We welcome contributions and improvements.

### Coding Style

All PHP code must pass [WordPress-Core](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards).

For more information about JavaScript and CSS, please see our [Coding Style](https://github.com/SQweb-team/SQweb-Coding-Style) guide.

### Building

Builds are handled with `gulp`. To get a build of the plugin, simply execute `gulp`. This will handle minification and packaging, and prepare a zip for you in `dist/`.

By default, the `build/` folder is automatically removed. If you want to keep it, say for debugging, you can build the plugin using `gulp keep-build`.

### Releasing

Please see [Release.md](Release.md).
